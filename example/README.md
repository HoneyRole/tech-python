python + react + webpack example
================================

This example illustrates how:
- A single codebase can be used to generate server-side 
  rendered HTML as well client-side interactivity.
- To pre-render HTML so that you can optimise for search-engines.
- Server-side rendering enables you to gracefully-degrade 
  interactive features on clients without JavaScript enabled.


Running the example
-------------------

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
python example.py
```
